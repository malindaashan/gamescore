Below are the API's developed

Request Body - {
"userId":1,
"gameId1":1,
"score": 12.33
}

### GET - "/api/v1/score/top10" (Create a REST API to sort and retrieve a game's top ten highest scores.)
Request param - gameId (Integer)

### GET - "/api/v1/score/user-highest-score" ( A REST API to obtain the user's highest scores in each game.)

####  Improve Performances
And if we are improve the performance we can have an index on score table where userId and gameId is saved. 

Also we can use pagination on api retrievals.

We can implement caching service as an intermediate.

#### Assumptions made

A new table has been created called score which has many to one relationships with Game and User entities
